          Non-essential businesses across New York state and the country are
          closed due to the coronavirus.The New York state department of labor
          has been tracking those temporary closings.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          So far there are over 1,000 small businesses that have
          <a href="https://labor.ny.gov/app/warn/"> filed </a> in the New York
          City region. Of those, less than one tenth have employees that are
          unionized, according to their filings. That’s slightly lower than the
          national rate of union membership, which was 10.3 percent in 2019,
          down from upwards of 20 percent in 1983, according to the Bureau of
          Labor Statistics.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The most common union among those that have filed is the
          <a href="https://hotelworkers.org/about/who-we-are">
            New York Hotel & Motel Trades Council</a
          >, AFL-CIO. Sixty-five businesses on the list have employee members of
          this union, which has been operating for over 70 years. About 75% of
          New York City’s hotels employ members of the New York Hotel & Motel
          Trades Council. Its more than 400,000 members work in non-managerial
          positions such as housekeeping, concierge, room service, and
          electrical jobs in hotels and casinos.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Union membership has been declining in the US in recent decades,
          especially due to the decline in manufacturing in the country.
          Unionization has not picked up in other sectors to compensate for the
          decline.

          Those employees that are part of unions may have more protections in
          the form of advocacy for safety conditions upon their return to work,
          as well as healthcare protection and greater information as well as
          advocacy during the period when their workplace is shut.
